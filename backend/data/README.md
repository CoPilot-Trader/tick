# Data Sources

This directory contains utilities for accessing data sources:
- Stock price data APIs
- News APIs
- Other external data sources

## Usage

Data access utilities should be shared across agents to avoid duplication.

## Notes

- Keep API keys secure (use environment variables)
- Implement rate limiting
- Add caching where appropriate
- Handle API failures gracefully
